First, let's see the most straightforward definition of entropy. Entropy is the measure of disorder and randomness in a closed system.
In machine learning, entropy is also a measure of randomness and is used to describe the disroder of the information processed in ML project. Basically, the easier it is to draw valuable conclusions from a piece of information, the lower the entropy in machine learning.

Low entropy -> low randomness -> low uncertainty -> more accurate.
